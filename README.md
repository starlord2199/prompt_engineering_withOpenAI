# Prompt Engineering & Programming with OpenAI

This repository contains my work from the Prompt Engineering & Programming with OpenAI course, which focuses on building practical skills to design, implement, and deploy generative AI solutions using OpenAI’s models and APIs.

# 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on applications of large language models (LLMs). It showcases how to effectively design prompts and integrate LLM-powered workflows to automate tasks, enhance user experiences, and prototype intelligent applications.

# 🛠️ How It’s Achieved

The projects here are built through a structured learning path that includes:

Prompt Engineering – Applying zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to steer LLM responses effectively.

API Integration – Using the OpenAI API and LangChain to connect Python scripts with generative AI capabilities.

Experimentation in Google Colab – Running and iterating on code efficiently in a cloud-based environment.

Mini Projects – Translating concepts into small, functional prototypes that can be extended into real-world applications.

# 📦 Output

By the end of the course, the following outcomes were delivered:

Reusable Prompts for text generation, summarization, and document Q&A.

Code Templates for integrating OpenAI models into apps and workflows.

Mini Projects demonstrating:

Summarization of large text documents

Conversational Q&A applications

Image generation pipelines

Automation workflows using LangChain

# 🚀 Tech Stack

Python 3.11+

OpenAI API

LangChain

Google Colab

Optional: DeepSeek API
